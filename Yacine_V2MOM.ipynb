    "## Vision\n",
    "\n",
    "- We want to become the IA consultancy of reference in Strasbourg, in France, and in Europe\n",
    "- We want to make our life and our clients life easier by adding value to their and our workflows, processes, and products\n",
    "- We want to be a force for good through open-source and ethical AI\n",
    "\n",
    "## Values\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fun**: We want to have fun at work, and we want our clients to have fun working with us, \"wow effect\" all the way !\n",
    "- **Expertise**: Through constant learning and developing, we want to be the best at what we do\n",
    "- **Ethics**: We respect our clients, our colleagues, the environment, our clients customers, etc. privacy and we build products that don't harm others\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Artficacts**: Every time we look into something, whether it's technical watch, improvning or developing a product, we create reusable artifacts that we can use for future projects and that will help us accelerate our work \n",
    "- **Comunication**: We communicate a lot within the squad, within Reboot, with our clients, with the industry, with the open-source community, and with the World\n",
    "- **Infrastructure**: We need to step up our game in CI/CD, MLOps, etc. to be able to deliver faster and better\n",
    "- **Open-Source**: If an artifact is not business-critical, we open-source it\n",
    "- **Planning**: We plan our work and we work our plan\n",
    "- **Profit**: We need to make money quick to be able to sustain our growth and our development (quick wins, long term vision)\n",
    "- **Technical Watch**: We will deal with the latest technologies and we will be on the lookout for the next big thing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Obstacles\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dispersion**: What can happen if we display a lot of energy without producing artifacts\n",
    "- **Lack of focus on profit**: It is vital that we have money on our mind, at least when we launch a new iteration\n",
    "- **Managing other work obligations**: We all have other work obligations, we need to be able to manage them\n",
    "- **No communication**: If we don't communicate, we can't work together\n",
    "- **No discipline**: If we all agree to do things a certain way and within a given time frame, we need to deliver and follow the initial plan; if the plan needs to be changed, this needs to be done in an organized way\n",
    "- **No profit**: We make no money, we can't sustain our growth\n",
    "- **Poor planning and workload evaluation**: We can be either too ambitious at a given step, or not ambitious enough, tackling on a new iteration should be done with care\n",
    "- **Solo work**: Brilliant minds can do stuff\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measures\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is every squad member happy ?\n",
    "- Are we making money ?\n",
    "- Are we producing reusable artifacts ? (courses, blog posts, open-source projects, clients products, etc.)\n",
    "- Do we communicate regularly on various channels ?\n",
    "- Hackathons, Tech Party Days, etc.\n"
